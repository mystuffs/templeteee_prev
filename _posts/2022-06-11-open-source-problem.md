## Issues with Open Source

The main issue with Open Source is the community that is the behind of Open Source. Yes, you heard it right!\
While Open Source is the part of our daily life, especially in technology, I can clearly say the community of Open Source is toxic enough.\
They're mean to support it not just destroying and when you saw that it's being destroyed by their authors or other people, it's feels like it shouldn't interfare with out daily life. It feel like I'm more happy to share my data\
with companies.

#### Your may think
- Why is that so? What's the main problem?
- Where Open Source community is toxic?
- Why you suddenly talking about companies interfare?
