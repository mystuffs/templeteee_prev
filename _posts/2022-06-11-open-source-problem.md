## Introduction

Open Source as you can see by its name, means making the source available for public. Where you and other can contribute to that project without any limitations of any company.\
For more information, kindly check it out [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)

## Issues with Open Source

The main issue with Open Source is the community that is the behind of Open Source. Yes, you heard it right!\
While Open Source is the part of our daily life, especially in technology, I can clearly say the community of Open Source is toxic enough.\
They're mean to support it not just destroying and when you saw that it's being destroyed by their authors or other people, it's feels like it shouldn't interfare with out daily life. It feel like I'm more happy to share my data with companies.

#### You may think

- Why is that so? What's the main problem?
- Where Open Source community is toxic?
- Why you suddenly talking about companies interfare?

- <u>Why is that so? What's the main problem?</u>\
The answer of this question I've already told above. But I'll write it more clearly about the fact.\
While community is a great way to work together, build something that's awesome in work and the trust of open source. But that's not what you'll found in most cases. People have different choices, and these people stuck what they actually like, even you feel that your idea is good enough,
someone else already have their own idea to port it, and they most likely won't move from their decision that what you'd do when you'll face this kind of situation.
This makes collaborating harder than what you can do while you'll work on a company. As a result, the program cames out with a mess of stuff which a end-user won't like to bother.
Everyone loves "just works" theory, even you at some point in your life. But the real truth is Open Source failed to do that else they're just doing what's everyone have in their mind (own preferences) instead of looking what a end-user expect.
This is the part where companies won the race, as they make programs for a "normal computar user" expectations not just only customization of the behaviour.

- <u>Where Open Source community is toxic?</u>\
Toxicity. If you're an online user, especially when you're dealing with tweets you may saw what toxicity can affect a person. Open Source community isn't an exceptional. Talking from forum to other chat platform, most of communitys' are toxic.
For example, if you're a Windows or macOS user, you're going to get a bad experience while talking with these communities'. They often publicly throws hateful speech towards Windows/macOS users'. Especially Windows as it've compared low security
than what other operating systems have. This is true about the security and how Microsoft spying on us. But this isn't fair to give hateful speech as they're using Windows. These communities' don't know what a user expect in todays' era, else they
just stick with barebone craps.\
Probably every tech enthusists knows about GNU/Linux. As everyone, I also admit that GNU/Linux is much more stable and productive than Windows. But not at all. For example, if you're using Linux Mint and you go to their support forum and for reason
if you ask any basic question directly, and your thread caught by a toxic "nerd", they'll kill your thoughts about GNU/Linux. The hate speech, worst behaviour towards religions, just a few, I told it here. And like Linux Mint, other Mint like distros'
won't be anything new. This is also a reson some GNU/Linux distros' support forums always/mostly stay inactive.\
But it doesn't mean all communites are toxic. If you ask the same question in Ubuntu forums, by changing a bit (as Linux Mint uses Ubuntu as the base and Ubuntu uses Debian as the base), you'll get a satisfied answer or even will get a greetings.
Or what you can, for more fast answer you can also join to unofficial Ubuntu Discord server without fearing Richard Stallman.\
Surprisingly, Open Source & GNU/Linux (part of Open Source) communitys' don't comment much about Apple and their products, yet it's known that macOS have code from FreeBSD (Berkeley UNIX). Is it because macOS is much more secure than they could imagine or did they thought it'll be yet another Windows clone?
...Or is it because it's too much costly?

- <u>Why you suddenly talking about companies interfare?</u>\
Here's my question for you, why do you hate Microsoft, Google, Apple, Oracle, Adobe etc?
The reason from you might be they stole our data. But it doesn't mean you need to hate it anyway. Whenever a user little bit talking about companies especially Microsoft, they just give their hateful words towards them which represents how abnormal the community is.
They might take your data and they do that for their preferences and what it makes company to grow. Now are you going to remove every companies and want to add Richard Stallman to the place, the guy who truely represent him as worthless for Free Software Foundation.
You need to admit that everything can't be just Open Source, companies don't work by this way, they'd obviously need some profit to give their employs the salary.
And here's the thing, some companies like Microsoft, Canonical uses Open Source and not only that, many tech giants contribute in Open Source to grow it. For example Microsoft truely moves towards Open Source, check out their GitHub [https://github.com/Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft), and the comminity
of Open Source won't understand it else they'll told like GitHub is proprietary. Man, this isn't 90 century era, this is 21 century and those old thoughts are disgusting. If you're like Richard Stallman, and thought "old never gets old" then you're in wrong place.
Everything gets old, and it's true, stop being moving for disgusting thoughts that old never gets old.\
Communities which are runs by companies are much more standardize than Open Source commmunity, why? While you may don't need standardize community and want to stick whatever you're now, that's okay in your opinion not acceptable for rest of the world. You can't get 24/7 job from Open Source, and money is a important in our daily life.
Companies often offer for job enquiries, and if you're good enough in that place you may get a good job in that sector. And this may happen that you hate that company and at last you got a job there. Not only for job, many different tech companies help in child education foundations, health care foundations by donating a large amount
of money. Tech isn't only mean for software, it means a lot.\
In simple words, do Open Source, use Open Source, but just stop hating tech companies especially these communitys'.
 
## Community Quarrel

Recently GitHub announced that they'll stop maintaining Atom IDE. Therefore it'll be [archive](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/) on December 15, 2022. After that announcement, Open Source community on GitHub, they're looks like going to kill each other on Atom repository.
They've started their hate speech towards Atom, as it's going to archive. I understood why theu're going to archive it, but it doesn't mean that you're going to give hatespeech.
